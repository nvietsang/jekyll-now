My name is Sang. I'm currently a Master Student at the University of Limoges, France (CRYPTIS PROGRAM). The major I focus on is Information Security.

I got a B.E degree in Computer Science (HONORS PROGRAM) at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT) in 2019. My thesis was to build a system for Question-Answering problem applying Deep Learning in Vietnamese.

I always open to make friends with interesting people. Feel free to contact me via social media !
