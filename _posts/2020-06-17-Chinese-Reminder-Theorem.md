title: Useful Maths for CS Engineers in Crypto
---

*(Part 3: Chinese Reminder Theorem)*

Working in Cryptography needs a good knowledge at Maths. However, for a Computer Science Engineer (such as me), Maths sometimes seems to be too complicated to absorb. So I realize that it is useful to summarize some typical theorems which usually appears whenever working in Cryptography. They includes

+ [Fermat's Little Theorem](https://nvietsang.github.io/2020-06-14-Useful-Maths-for-CS-Engineers-in-Crypto)
+ [Fast Exponential](https://nvietsang.github.io/2020-06-16-Fast-Exponential)
+ [The Chinese Reminder Theorem](https://nvietsang.github.io/2020-06-16-Chinese-Reminder-Theorem)
+ [Euclidean Algorithm](https://nvietsang.github.io/2020-06-16-Euclidean-Algorithm)
+ [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](https://nvietsang.github.io/2020-06-16-Extended-Euclidean-Algorithm)
+ [Bézout’s theorem](https://nvietsang.github.io/2020-06-16-Extended-Euclidean-Algorithm)
