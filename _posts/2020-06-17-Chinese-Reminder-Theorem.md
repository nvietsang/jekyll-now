title: Useful Maths for CS Engineers in Crypto
---

Working in Cryptography needs a good knowledge at Maths. However, for a Computer Science Engineer (such as me), Maths sometimes seems to be too complicated to absorb. So I realize that it is useful to summarize some typical theorems which usually appears whenever working in Cryptography. They includes

+ [Fermat's Little Theorem](2020-06-14-Useful-Maths-for-CS-Engineers-in-Crypto.md)
+ [Fast Exponential](2020-06-16-Fast-Exponential.md)
+ [The Chinese Reminder Theorem](2020-06-16-Chinese-Reminder-Theorem.md)
+ [Euclidean Algorithm](2020-06-16-Euclidean-Algorithm.md)
+ [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](2020-06-16-Extended-Euclidean-Algorithm.md)
+ [Bézout’s theorem](2020-06-16-Extended-Euclidean-Algorithm.md)
