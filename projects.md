## Personal

## Internship
[Knorex](https://www.knorex.com) - Research Scientist Intern
+ **Language Detection:** Fixed bugs. Evaluated and improved 60% in accuracy when detecting Malaysian and Indonesian.  Added the ability to detect 5 new languages.

+ **Key Mining:** Evaluated and improved 10-20% in accuracy to extract keywords related to a certain topic in passages. Added the ability to extract keywords for 5 new languages.

+ **Document Filtering:** Prepared data to feed [DAZER model](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1214).

## Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT)
These are educational projects which I did in different courses at HCMUT.
+ **Question-Answering (thesis):** Processed [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset. Re-implemented the Deep Learning model [QANet](https://research.google/pubs/pub46691/) to predict an answer for a question with a English passage; Built a dataset for Vietnamese (about 10K samples). Built a model based on QANet working on Vietnamese (Exact Match 61.0%, F1-score 76.6%).

+ **Smart Light (Global Project Based Learning):** Led a team of 6 members, including Vietnamese and Japanese students.  Designed a system with automatic light control and alarm for theft warning.  Built an Arduino circuit and wrote C program. [GitHub](https://github.com/nvietsang/smart-light-project) [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqi_0X2tpN4)

+ **Mini C (Principles of Programming Languages course):** Used Scalar to implement the interpreter/compiler of a new language called **Mini C** which consists of a subset of C plus some Java language features. Implemented and wrote test cases for lexical analyzer by using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org), syntax analyzer by generating abstract syntax tree (AST), semantic analyzer (e.g. type compatibility, scope constraints), code generator (for a stack-based machine like JVM).

+ **Bus Ticket Booking Application:** Worked with a team of 5 members. Designed ERD/EERD and implemented database with SQL. Used Servlet to implement server features with Java.

+ **LineXO (Mobile Application Development course):** Worked with a team of 4 members to build an Android application of game. Designed database and implemented with Firebase.
