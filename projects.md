These are educational projects which I did in different courses at HCMUT.
+ **Question-Answering (thesis):** Processed [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset. Re-implemented the Deep Learning model [QANet](https://research.google/pubs/pub46691/) to predict an answer for a question with a English passage; Built a dataset for Vietnamese (about 10K samples). Built a model based on QANet working on Vietnamese (Exact Match 61.0%, F1-score 76.6%).

+ **Smart Light (Global Project Based Learning):** Led a team of 6 members, including Vietnamese and Japanese students.  Designed a system with automatic light control and alarm for theft warning.  Built an Arduino circuit and wrote C program. [GitHub](https://github.com/nvietsang/smart-light-project) [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqi_0X2tpN4)
